# lendingClub
Project for looking at lending Club data 
Our tool is to allow users to make better loan decisions in the
peer­to­peer lending market! It would work by allowing the user to select different
criteria for clustering the data of loan types. This tool will provide the user with the
loan options that have the highest rate of return from the filters or criteria they
have selected. We will be using the K Nearest Neighbors to sort through the data using 15 seperate critera.
